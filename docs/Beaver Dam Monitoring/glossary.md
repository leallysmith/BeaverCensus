Example photos and definitions of terms that may be useful for beaver dam data collection. Some measurements are also unclear in the survey and this glossary will define how those measurements are taken.

## Complex Monitoring



Average Flow: Typical flow, use a USGS gage or else it's usually the flow a bit after runoff but before base flow that can happen in the fall.

Base Flow: This is the minimum flow of a river and is a result of groundwater seepage rather than runoff.

Beaver Dam:

Beaver Dam Analogue: A manmade structure built to mimic a beaver dam, these can be built with posts or postless.

Beaver Dam Complex: A series of beaver dams, typically a mix of primary and secondary dams.

Breach:

Dam Crest: The top edge of a dam.

Dam Height:

Dam Notching: This is something humans do when a dam is ponding so much water that it causes flooding that affects nearby infrastructure. Dam notches are notches cut into dams to let some water through so that the pond depth is decreased.

Food Caching: A pile of bark, twigs, and leaves that beavers use as a winter store of food. This is usually found in the pond behind a dam.

Lodge: There are two types of lodges beavers can build. One is a bank lodge and the other is what you might typically think of when you think of a lodge. These lodges are found in the large pond that forms behind a primary dam. Bank lodges are close to the bank and include tunnels dug through the bank. The other type of lodge looks like a pile of mud and sticks in the middle of the pond.

Material Harvest:

Primary Dam: The largest dams in a complex, these dams usually extend onto the floodplain and create the ponds beaver place their lodge in.

Primary Water Surface Drop:

Skid Trail Usage:

Secondary Dam: Smaller dams that typically span only the active channel and not extending onto the floodplain, these dams create smaller ponds that allow beaver to travel up and downstream in safety.

Scent Mound: Otherwise known as a castor mound, these are piles of mud around beaver ponds that are used to mark territory. Beaver secrete castoreum from a gland onto these piles. The scent has been described as a musky vanilla or leathery.

## BRAT cIS

Age of Activity:

Anabranch:

Blowout:

Breach:

Ephemeral: A stream that only flows when there is a storm/runoff event that feeds it water. These usually dry up shortly after the event.

Food Caching: A pile of bark, twigs, and leaves that beavers use as a winter store of food. This is usually found in the pond behind a dam.

Intermittent: Streams that flow for a short while after run off but not year round

Material Harvest:

Perennial:
