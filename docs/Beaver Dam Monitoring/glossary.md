Example photos and definitions of terms that may be useful for beaver dam data collection. Some measurements are also unclear in the survey and this glossary will define how those measurements are taken. There is a survey123 edition of this glossary which can be downloaded to the mobile app and taken offline. However, the survey123 edition won't have images. That survey is available [here](https://arcg.is/1vfHf9). You can also scan this QR code using your device for easier access.

## Complex Monitoring

Average Flow: Typical flow, use a USGS gage. Average flow is the "normal" flow, not the higher flows of runoff or the lower base flows.

Base Flow: This is the minimum flow of a river and is a result of groundwater seepage rather than runoff.

Beaver Dam:

Beaver Dam Analogue: A manmade structure built to mimic a beaver dam, these can be built with posts or postless.

Beaver Dam Complex: A series of beaver dams, typically a mix of primary and secondary dams.

Blowout: A dam blowout is catastrophic damage to the dam. This dam holds back very limited water because so much has been knocked out.

Breach: This is mild damage to the dam so that it doesn't hold back all water but isn't completely broken away.

Dam Crest: The top edge of a dam.

Dam Height: Measured from bottom of dam on the downstream side to the dam crest.

Dam Notching: This is something humans do when a dam is ponding so much water that it causes inundation which affects nearby infrastructure. Dam notches are notches cut into dams to let some water through so that the pond depth and inundation extent are decreased.

Food Caching: A pile of bark, twigs, and leaves that beavers use as a winter store of food. This is usually found in the pond behind a dam.

Lodge: There are two types of lodges beavers can build. One is a bank lodge and the other is what you might typically think of when you think of a lodge. These lodges are found in the large pond that forms behind a primary dam. Bank lodges are close to the bank and include tunnels dug through the bank. The other type of lodge looks like a pile of mud and sticks in the middle of the pond.

Material Harvest: Main evidence here is freshly felled trees with a pile of wood shavings around the cut.

Primary Dam: The largest dams in a complex, these dams usually extend onto the floodplain and create the ponds beaver place their lodge in.

Primary Water Surface Drop: This is a measurement taken in the pond behind a primary dam.

Skid Trail Usage: Skid trails are little paths of packed down grass or compacted dirt that beaver use to drag materials into the pond.

Secondary Dam: Smaller dams that typically span only the active channel and not extending onto the floodplain, these dams create smaller ponds that allow beaver to travel up and downstream in safety.

Scent Mound: Otherwise known as a castor mound, these are piles of mud around beaver ponds that are used to mark territory. Beaver secrete castoreum from a gland onto these piles. The scent has been described as a musky vanilla or leathery.

Age of Activity: Assessing age of activity will primarily rely on looking at how old the chewed wood looks. When beavers chew trees down they usually leave a pile of wood chips behind. Both the color of these and the stump of the tree they came from can be used to estimate when a beaver 

Anabranch: Branches from the main stem of the river that rejoin the river downstream.

Backwater: Backwaters are where the water is delivered by back flow as a result of some downstream channel restriction rather than being delivered by the current of the river.

Blowout: A dam blowout is catastrophic damage to the dam. This dam holds back very limited water because so much has been knocked out.

Breach: This is mild damage to the dam so that it doesn't hold back all water but isn't completely broken away.

Channel Setting:

Ephemeral: A stream that only flows when there is a storm/runoff event that feeds it water. These usually dry up shortly after the event.

Food Caching: A pile of bark, twigs, and leaves that beavers use as a winter store of food. This is usually found in the pond behind a dam.

Intermittent: Streams that flow for some time after run off but not year round, these dry up or have disconnected residual ponds at some point in the year.

Material Harvest: Main evidence here is freshly felled trees with a pile of wood shavings around the cut.

Perennial: Perennial streams flow year round, without drying up during the year.

Proximity to Expansion Zone: This metric is one that evaluates the potential for the expansion of the beaver's range. As beaver reproduce and the colony grows the older kits will be dispersing into the broader area.
