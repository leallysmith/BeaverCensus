Dam Notching:

Food Caching: A pile of bark, twigs, and leaves that beavers use as a winter store of food. This is usually found in the pond behind a dam.

Material Harvest:

Primary Dam: The largest dams in a complex, these dams usually extend onto the floodplain and create the ponds beaver place their lodge in.

Secondary Dam: Smaller dams that typically span only the active channel and not extending onto the floodplain, these dams create smaller ponds that allow beaver to travel up and downstream in safety.

Scent Mound: Otherwise known as a castor mound, these are piles of mud around beaver ponds that are used to mark territory. Beaver secrete castoreum from a gland onto these piles. The scent has been described as a musky vanilla or leathery.
