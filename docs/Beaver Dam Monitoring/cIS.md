BRAT cIS is a way to run the BRAT model in the field using observations of what is seen on the ground.

This can be useful as a quick way to get a rough estimate of the restoration potential for a reach. The capacity inference system comes in a basic and an advanced form. These forms come as printouts or as Survey123 forms. The paper forms have rule tables that guide you through if-and statements for inputs and then it leads to the output. The Survey123 forms take user input and then generate the output for you.
