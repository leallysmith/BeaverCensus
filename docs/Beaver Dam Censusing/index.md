Approaches for collecting beaver data virtually and on the ground and a way to run the BRAT tool in the field.

## Virtual Beaver Dam Censusing

Virtual beaver dam censusing can be done in areas with sufficiently clear imagery and is a way to evaluate beaver dam presence in remote areas where it might be difficult to send field crews or large areas that might otherwise be impractical to survey.

## On the Ground Beaver Complex Censusing

On the ground beaver complex censusing is another option for censusing dams, this can be useful in places that don't have high resolution imagery or if there is dense tree cover that covers the stream.

## BRAT cIS

Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool Capacity Inference System is a way to run [BRAT](brat.riverscapes.xyz) in the field. There are two forms, one a more basic version and the second is a more advanced form with additional ways to evaluate the capacity of a reach.
