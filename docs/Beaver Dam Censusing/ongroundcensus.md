On the ground beaver structure monitoring is useful for monitoring changes over time to complexes. These forms also include options if there are manmade BDAs in the stream. None of the questions in the Survey123 forms are required for submission, so record what is necessary and possible then submit.

The basic complex form covers whether the dams were beaver built, their status, and the type of complex, size of complex, and where the dams are.

The advanced complex form has all of the basic form and additional space to record measurements, side channels, extent, materials used, sediment build up, and check boxes for signs of recent beaver maintenance.

There is an additional option for monitoring which is a form that focuses on dam level monitoring, this approach can be less useful because individual dams rise and fall but complexes usually stick around. The form for individual dam monitoring has questions about whether dams were beaver built, the type of dam, the status of that dam, and location of the dam.



These forms come as printable forms and as Survey123 apps.
