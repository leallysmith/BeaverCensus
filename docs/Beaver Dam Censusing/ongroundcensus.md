On the ground beaver complex monitoring is useful for monitoring changes over time to complexes. These forms also include options if there are manmade BDAs in the stream.

The basic form covers whether the dams were beaver built, their status, and the type of complex, size of complex, and where the dams are.

The advanced form has all of the basic form and additional space to record measurements, side channels, extent, materials used, sediment build up, and check boxes for signs of recent beaver maintenance.



These forms come as printable forms and as Survey123 apps.
